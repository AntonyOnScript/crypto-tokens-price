To run locally you can use `docker-compose up` or `yarn dev`

Here i used Vue 3 with Vite instead vue-cli because vite has more performance than that;
Components autoload and ESLint to improve dev environment;
Tailwind as a simple style ui and Datepicker component to make it faster to develop;
All that with the option to run locally with docker to prevent errors.
